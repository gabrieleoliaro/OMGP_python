# OMGP_python
This is a translation of the Code for "Overlapping Mixtures of Gaussian Processes for the data association problem" by Miguel LÃ¡zaro-Gredilla into Python

Once we finish the translation of each function to Python, it would be nice to congregate all of them together into one or a few classes. So far each function is in its own file, and that can be probably optimized.
