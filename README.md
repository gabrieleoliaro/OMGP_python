# OMGP_python
This is a translation of the Code for "Overlapping Mixtures of Gaussian Processes for the data association problem" by Miguel LÃ¡zaro-Gredilla into Python

Once we finish the translation of each function to Python, it would be nice to congregate all of them together into one or a few classes. So far each function is in its own file, and that can be probably optimized.

This program requires Python 3. If you run it on Python 3, and it still doesn't work, make sure that you have installed the required dependecies (e.g. matplotlib) not just for python, but for python3 specifically.
To do so, you need to have pip for python 3 installed, and you have to run commands such as 'pip3 install matplotlib'.
