# OMGP_python
This is the code for a 2D Gaussian Process Regression based upon the paper "Overlapping Mixtures of Gaussian Processes for the data association problem" by Miguel LÃ¡zaro-Gredilla et al.

The code is not very fast, so it needs to be optimized.
Something to do is to make the program available on python versions earlier than 3.x, so that it can be run with the simple 'python' command
It would also help to rewrite/refactor the code into OOP

This program requires Python 3. If you run it on Python 3, and it still doesn't work, make sure that you have installed the required dependecies (e.g. matplotlib) not just for python, but for python3 specifically.
To do so, you need to have pip for python 3 installed, and you have to run commands such as 'pip3 install matplotlib'.
